# NBA Data Drift Detection

This project focuses on detecting data drift in an NBA dataset over multiple seasons. Data drift refers to changes in the statistical properties of the dataset over time, which can impact the performance and reliability of machine learning models.

## Introduction

The NBA Data Drift Detection project aims to monitor and identify shifts in various statistical properties of NBA game data over time. Detecting data drift is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and effectiveness of predictive models used for player and team performance analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains statistics from all NBA games over multiple seasons. Key features include points, rebounds, assists, three-point attempts, and more.
